# Images-with-OpenCV-and-Python-Libraries

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

This OpenCV tutorial will help you learn the Image-processing from Basics to Advance, like operations on Images, Videos using a huge set of Opencv-programs and projects.

Image processing and computer vision tasks include displaying, cropping, flipping, rotating, image segmentation, classification, image restoration, image recognition, image generation. Also, working with images via the cloud requires storing, transmitting, and gathering images through the internet.

Python is an excellent choice as it has many image processing tools, computer vision and artificial intelligence libraries. Finally, it has many libraries for working with files in the cloud and on the internet.

A digital image is simply a file in your computer. In this lab, you will gain an understanding of these files and learn to work with these files with the Pillow Library (PIL).
